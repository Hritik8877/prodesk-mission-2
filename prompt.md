## Cash-Flow (Salary & Expense Tracker) — AI Prompt Log

**Intern:** Hritik Kumar  
**Project:** Week 2 Mission — JavaScript Logic Dashboard  
---

## 🎯 Purpose of this File
This document records how AI assistance was used during the development of this project.

The objective was **learning and debugging**, not auto-generating the project.  
All UI structure, logic flow, and implementation decisions were written manually.

AI was used only when:
- Errors occurred
- Concepts were unclear
- Debugging assistance was required
- Best practices needed clarification

---

## 🧠 Development Workflow
1. Implemented features using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
2. Tested functionality in browser.
3. Debugged using Console and manual checking.
4. Used AI prompts only to understand issues.
5. Applied learned solutions independently.

## 🤖 AI Prompts Used During Development

### 1️⃣ DOM Manipulation Issue
**Prompt**
Explain why `querySelector` sometimes returns null and how to safely access DOM elements after page load.

**Learning**
- Importance of DOM loading
- Usage of `DOMContentLoaded`
- Correct script placement

---

### 2️⃣ Event Listener Not Triggering
**Prompt**
My button click event is not working in JavaScript. What are common mistakes in event listeners?

**Learning**
- Correct element targeting
- Avoid duplicate IDs
- Proper event binding

---

### 3️⃣ Expense Calculation Logic
**Prompt**
Explain how to calculate total expenses from an array of objects using JavaScript reduce() with simple logic.

**Learning**
- Array iteration
- `reduce()` method
- Dynamic balance calculation

---

### 4️⃣ Form Validation
**Prompt**
How to prevent empty or negative values in a JavaScript form without page reload?

**Learning**
- `event.preventDefault()`
- Input validation
- Number checking techniques

---

### 5️⃣ LocalStorage Persistence
**Prompt**
Explain how to store and retrieve objects using localStorage with JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.

**Learning**
- Data persistence
- Saving application state
- Loading saved data on refresh

---

### 6️⃣ Delete Expense Feature
**Prompt**
How can I delete a specific item from an array and re-render the DOM dynamically?

**Learning**
- Array filtering
- Updating UI after state change
- Dynamic DOM rendering

---

### 7️⃣ Chart.js Integration
**Prompt**
How to dynamically update a Chart.js pie chart when data changes?

**Learning**
- Chart updates
- Data synchronization with UI

---

## 🧩 Concepts Strengthened
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- JavaScript Arrays & Objects
- Real-time Calculations
- LocalStorage Data Persistence
- Dynamic UI Updates
- Debugging Techniques

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
This project reinforced the understanding that modern web applications rely heavily on JavaScript logic and real-time UI updates.

AI was used as a **learning assistant**, helping to understand problems rather than replacing development effort.

---

## ✅ Declaration
All major implementation, project structure, and logic were created by me.  
AI assistance was used only for explanations, debugging guidance, and concept clarification.
